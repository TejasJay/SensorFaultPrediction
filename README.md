# SensorFaultPrediction

Building and designing a complete System Architecture to predict failure of Wafer-sensors by classification methodology using Random forest and XGBoost based on the feedback data given by injection mould sensors. 

# Business Problem

Macro Technologies ltd., is a medium scale plastic injection mould industry. This is the first business that got me the opportunity to work and play with data. Plastic injection moulding is the process of injecting plastic into huge moulds to form desired products. It is widely used in Automotive sectors to produce carbon fiber and plastic polymer parts. For the process of plastic injection, multiple sensors/wafers are installed to process the inputs and data is collected as feedback for each sensor. Due to high production rate, these sensors fail on a regular basis. When the sensor fails the production needs to be halted to replace the sensor to continue production. Due to this production downtime, the industry faces huge production losses and is not able to deliver the products on time as per the clients requirements.To minimize this downfall the industry wants to predict if the sensor is going to fail, beforehand, so that sensor/wafer replacements can be made before starting the production.

# Solution

Here we implemented an end to end solution, which <b>increased the production by 20% and cut downtime by 15%, in turn generating more revenue and delivering the products according to the clientâ€™s requirement.</b> I have designed and built the complete system architecture to demonstrate how we solved the business problem. I am using a sample raw data that I used to build the solution, for this demonstration.

# Running the application

1) Download the code on your local machine and set a working environment
2) Install all the requirements on your terminal by typing ---> pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Run "main.py" file
4) Open Chrome browser and run localhost:5000
5) Click predict button
6) view the predicted file and logs once the prediction is complete
7) You can also view the input dataset for prediction on Prediction_Batch_files directory.
